Guano for Craft
===========

Guano is a plugin for Craft that adds a few, small GUI improvements to the control panel. At the moment, these improvements are:

- Adds a "Save and continue editing" button to the entry editing page. The button returns to the same tab that was open when the user saved. 
- Makes the right column in the entry editing page follow the top of the screen as the user scrolls down.

Visual improvements:

- Field headings/labels are made bold.
- Fields have a larger vertical margin (36px instead of 24px).
- Huds, except tool huds (clear cache, etc) have a minimum width of 400px. 

This is an experimental plugin that rather haphazardly adds some css and javascript to the control panel. 
Use at your own risk. Hopefully these things will make their way into Craft itself in due time.

Gua...what? 
--------
The defintion for Guano given by Wikipedia is:

*Guano (via Spanish, ultimately from the Quechua wanu) is the excrement of seabirds, cave-dwelling bats, pinnipeds, or (in English usage) birds more generally. As a manure, guano is a highly effective fertilizer due to its exceptionally high content of nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium, three nutrients essential for plant growth.*

Well, where I'm from (northern Norway), Guano is a by-product of the fishing industry. Millions of fish-heads, primarily from cod, is hung outside. 
When they're all dried up and rotten, they're ground up to flour and sold to southern Europe and Africa. Awesome way to make money. 

Why I called the plugin that? No reason whatsoever. :)
